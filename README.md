# ParkinsonGPT

### This is a chatbot application developed for an AI hackathon. Its primary purpose is to raise awareness about Parkinson's disease. 

It can be quite overwhelming to go through online content such as research papers and videos related to Parkinson's disease. There are many medical terms and concepts to understand, and it takes time to grasp the exact nature of the disease. To simplify this process, I developed ParkinsonGPT - a RAG chatbot that utilizes cutting-edge AI technology to provide a one-stop solution for individuals seeking information on Parkinson's disease.
